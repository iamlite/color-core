# Color Representation in color-core

Understanding how color-core represents colors internally is crucial for effective use of the library. This guide explains the core concepts of color representation in color-core.

## The Color Class

At the heart of color-core is the `Color` class. This class provides a unified way to work with colors across different color spaces.

```typescript
import { Color } from 'color-core';

const myColor = new Color('#FF5733');
```

## Internal Representation

Internally, the `Color` class stores colors in the RGB color space. This choice allows for efficient conversion between different color spaces.

```typescript
class Color {
    private _rgb: RGB;
    // ... other properties and methods
}
```

The `_rgb` property is of type `RGB`, which is defined as:

```typescript
type RGB = {
    r: number;
    g: number;
    b: number;
    a?: number;
};
```

## Color Creation

The `Color` constructor is flexible and can accept various input formats:

```typescript
// From hex string
const color1 = new Color('#FF5733');

// From RGB object
const color2 = new Color({ r: 255, g: 87, b: 51 });

// From HSL object
const color3 = new
